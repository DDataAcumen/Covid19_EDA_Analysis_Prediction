# Covid19 Pandemic_EDA-Analysis-and-Predictions

This Git Repository is designed  to Understand the impact of COVID-19 across Globe. It provides strong visulizations that  help us perceive how this Global Epidemic started and in no time flourished havoc around the world. Further Machine Learning Modelling applied gives us an idea of how the number of active cases cross economies is expected to rise, and how the number of fatalities will act with respect to number of cases and time ofcourse.


# Deploying Project on your Local System
You would require an active connection with Integrated developement Enviornment, preferably Visual Studio or Spyder, Covid-19.py file and the dataset indeed. With all this things you are pretty much ready to Proceed.


# Note1:
A part of code depicts the current situation of COVID-19 on a choropleth map for majourity of Nations. For this Particular visual the Lat & Long information is provide in a file named World_Map.shp. This file is also a part of current repository, So you need not to look for it.

# Methodology
Occam Razor problem solving convention has been followed.
Primarly Used Naive Bayes to Predict the confirmed cases w.r.t Nations. Since Naive Bayes is  a Probabilistic framework it fits better than other few techniniques. For Predicting fatalities cross States Regression trees were Used.


# Packages  Used
Majour use of Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Geopandas and Scikit Learn.
